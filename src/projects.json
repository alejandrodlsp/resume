It includes a fully modular system that divides the aircraft into it's individual components, making it very easy to create new types of aircraft using custom editor scripts. This side project that I made with help of a series of tutorials, taught me the power of physics based behaviours.",

Itâ€™s a fun little side-scroller platformer game, in which I managed to rank 59th for the audio category, 80th for the fun category and 165th for the overall category.",
